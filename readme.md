# Figma Unfloater
The Figma Unfloater changes Figma UI3, making the new floating sidebars stop floating on any Figma design files.

## Credits
The CSS was written by @imkylelambert (twitter), for use in an Arc Boost.

3. Go to chrome://extensions
4. Turn on Developer Mode in the top right.
5. Click "Load unpacked extension" in the top left.

You're good to go!

### How do I know this file is safe?
You can see all the files inside this installation. It's one CSS file, one JSON file, and one MD file.
There are also two .git files, which you can delete when you install. They set up this hosting on GitHub.
* Read through the CSS file. You can read and see that it only edits the properties of sidebar elements.
* Read the JSON file. You can see information about Chrome extension requirements, and that on sites `*://figma.com/design/*`, the CSS `styles.css` should be run.
* Read the MD file. It's just this description!

### Chrome Web Store
I'm working to get this put on the Chrome Web store.
